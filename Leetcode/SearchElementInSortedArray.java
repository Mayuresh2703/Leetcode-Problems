/*
 * There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
    Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
    Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
    You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
        Output: 4
    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
        Output: -1
    Example 3:
        Input: nums = [1], target = 0
        Output: -1
    Constraints:
        1 <= nums.length <= 5000
        -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
        All values of nums are unique.
        nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
        -104 <= target <= 104

                    high = mid - 1;

/*
 * Approach
        Given the properties of the array, it's tempting to perform a linear search. However, that would result in a time complexity of O(n)O(n)O(n). Instead, we can use the properties of the array to our advantage and apply a binary search to find the target with time complexity of O(log⁡n)O(\log n)O(logn) only.
    *Treating the Rotated Array
        Although the array is rotated, it retains some properties of sorted arrays that we can leverage. Specifically, one half of the array (either the left or the right) will always be sorted. This means we can still apply binary search by determining which half of our array is sorted and whether the target lies within it.
    *Binary Search
        Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.
